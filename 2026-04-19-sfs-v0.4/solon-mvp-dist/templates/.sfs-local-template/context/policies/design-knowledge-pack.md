# Design/Frontend Knowledge Pack Inventory

This file is a topic/proposition inventory, not the filled knowledge base.
Use it to decide which design/frontend concepts are active for a sprint, review,
or release. Record ids only unless the user asks for fill work.

## Activation Rules

- Activate design depth when users, operators, admins, or reviewers interact
  with a visible workflow.
- Do not make a marketing landing page when the work is an operational tool.
- Data-dense product surfaces need scanning, hierarchy, states, and task flow,
  not decorative composition.
- Accessibility and responsive fit are active whenever UI is user-facing.

## DES-SCALE - Review Depth By Project Size

- DES-SCALE-001: A prototype needs a clear primary task and obvious controls.
- DES-SCALE-002: MVP UI needs core flow, empty/loading/error/success states, and responsive fit.
- DES-SCALE-003: Production UI needs accessibility, consistency, copy quality, and failure recovery.
- DES-SCALE-004: Admin/operator UI needs audit trail, filters, timeline, permissions, and destructive-action safeguards.
- DES-SCALE-005: Multi-screen products need information architecture, navigation, and state continuity.
- DES-SCALE-006: Design-system work needs tokens, components, variants, usage rules, and migration plan.
- DES-SCALE-007: Brand/marketing work needs first-viewport signal, real assets, and conversion/action clarity.

## DES-PROP - Proposition Inventory

- DES-PROP-001: The primary user task must be visible without reading documentation.
- DES-PROP-002: UI hierarchy must support scanning, comparison, and repeated action for operational tools.
- DES-PROP-003: Empty, loading, error, disabled, partial, and success states are part of the design.
- DES-PROP-004: Controls should use familiar affordances such as icons, toggles, menus, tabs, sliders, and inputs.
- DES-PROP-005: Text must fit its container across mobile and desktop viewports.
- DES-PROP-006: Responsive layout needs stable constraints, not viewport-scaled typography.
- DES-PROP-007: Accessibility review includes keyboard, focus, contrast, labels, and motion tolerance.
- DES-PROP-008: Visual assets should reveal the actual product, state, place, or workflow when inspection matters.
- DES-PROP-009: Admin and CS screens should expose history, current state, source, reason, and next action.
- DES-PROP-010: Destructive or irreversible actions need confirmation, permission, and audit visibility.
- DES-PROP-011: Microcopy must use canonical domain terms from taxonomy.
- DES-PROP-012: Navigation must preserve user context when moving between related views.
- DES-PROP-013: Design-system additions need naming, variants, tokens, and reuse rationale.
- DES-PROP-014: Dense tables need sorting, filtering, pagination, selection, and column visibility strategy.
- DES-PROP-015: Forms need validation timing, error placement, recovery path, and saved-state behavior.
- DES-PROP-016: Charts and dashboards need clear units, time range, thresholds, and drill-down path.
- DES-PROP-017: Mobile constraints must be checked for touch targets, wrapping, overflow, and hierarchy.
- DES-PROP-018: User-facing language must avoid explaining implementation details inside the app.

## DES-GAP - Fill Slots For Later

- DES-GAP-002: Admin/CS timeline and reconciliation UX.
- DES-GAP-003: Form validation and recovery patterns.
- DES-GAP-004: Dashboard/chart review rubric.
- DES-GAP-005: Accessibility test checklist.
- DES-GAP-006: Design-system component governance.
- DES-GAP-007: Responsive QA viewport matrix.
- DES-GAP-008: UX writing and domain-language alignment guide.
