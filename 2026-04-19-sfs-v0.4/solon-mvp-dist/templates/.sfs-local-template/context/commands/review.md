# Review

- Adapter-run by default: run `sfs review ...` before summarizing.
- Do not create a new verdict from memory; use `review.md` and recorded result paths.
- Summaries should list verdict, findings, required actions, evidence, and next gate.
- The generator does not self-approve its own implementation.
