# Solon SFS — `/sfs`

User arguments:
```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

1. Verify `command -v sfs`.
2. Run `sfs <command> <args>`; vendored fallback:
   `bash .sfs-local/scripts/sfs-dispatch.sh <command> <args>`.
3. Print stdout verbatim; on failure include stderr and exit code.
4. Read `sfs context path kernel`, `sfs context path index`, then only the routed module. Resolve command modules as `sfs context path commands/<command>.md` (for example, `commands/start.md`) or via the command alias (`sfs context path start`).
5. For bash-first commands, do not refine artifacts, but a compact state/Next is allowed.
6. For `profile`, edit only the `SFS.md` project overview section.
7. For hybrid commands, refine pointed artifacts and answer with one Solon report.
8. AI-era fundamentals apply across all gates, not only implement: shared
   design concept, domain language, feedback loop, interface/artifact boundary,
   and gray-box delegation.
9. For implementation and review work, follow the routed context guardrails:
   surface material assumptions, choose the smallest useful slice, keep changes
   surgical, read actual files/errors before fixing, verify before completion,
   and report exact evidence.
   Gate 3 (Plan) ready-for-implement routes to `sfs review --gate 3` first;
   do not offer `sfs implement` or worker/model handoff until plan review
   passes. Keep C-Level and worker/generator responsibilities separate: C-Level
   owns intent, architecture, AC, and review handoff; worker/generator owns
   fixed implementation slices.
   Gate 3 review must self-review until PASS before cross review. Review round
   count, lens count, or "enough review" is not a PASS; partial/fail routes to
   rework and same-gate self-review.
10. `.sfs-local/` is private workbench state. Shared durable docs belong under
   `docs/solon/`; do not ask users to commit `.sfs-local` unless their team
   explicitly opts in.
11. In Solon reports, show gates as `Gate N (Name)`, not naked ids:
   Gate 1 (Intake), Gate 2 (Brainstorm), Gate 3 (Plan),
   Gate 4 (Design), Gate 5 (Handoff), Gate 6 (Review),
   Gate 7 (Retro). Use gate numbers 1..7 for new CLI examples.
12. Decision questions must be self-contained: before any `Q1`, `D1`, or
    option id, explain in plain user language what is being decided, why it
    matters, the recommended default, and what each option changes. Labels are
    cross-references, not the explanation.
